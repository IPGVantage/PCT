A static gulp site

`npm install`

`gulp` will build, compile, and watch any changes made to the files during development of the project. It will also start a proxy local server and will refresh during any changes during development of the project.

To manually output a static build for the IPG team:

`gulp compile`

That will generate flat HTML in the ./build directory. To generate a build for the IPG team, cd into ./build, zip everything up, and post it to the IPG team in Slack.
