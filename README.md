A static gulp site

`npm install`

`gulp build` will create a build directory with all the static files of the site.

`gulp move` and `gulp moveJS` might need to be ran to move js and data files to the src.
`gulp clean-all` will remove the build and node_modules directories.

`gulp` will build, compile, and watch any changes made to the files during development
of the project. It will also start a proxy local server and will refresh during any changes
during development of the project.
